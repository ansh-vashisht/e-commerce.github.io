            <p> E-commerce (electronic commerce) is the activity of electronically buying or selling of products on online services or over the Internet.</p>
            <p>It draws on technologies such as mobile commerce, electronic funds transfer, supply chain management, Internet marketing, online transaction processing, electronic data interchange (EDI), inventory management systems, and automated data collection systems.It is in turn driven by the technological advances of the semiconductor industry, and is the largest sector of the electronics industry.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Contemporary electronic commerce can be classified into two categories. The first category is business based on types of goods sold (involves everything from ordering "digital" content for immediate online consumption, to ordering conventional goods and services, to "meta" services to facilitate other types of electronic commerce). The second category is based on the nature of the participant (B2B, B2C, C2B and C2C).</p>      
            <br>
            <p>On the institutional level, big corporations and financial institutions use the internet to exchange financial data to facilitate domestic and international business. Data integrity and security are pressing issues for electronic commerce.</p>
